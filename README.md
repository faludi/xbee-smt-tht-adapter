XBee SMT -> THT Adapter, including XBee PRO SX

These SMT to THT adapter boards are now updated to support the <a href="http://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/Digidocs/90001477/Default.htm">XBee PRO SX 1-watt modules</a>. This adapter will work with any surface mount XBee. The SMT module is soldered onto the top of the adapter board, and 2mm XBee THT footprint male headers are soldered to the bottom. For the XBee PRO SX, a heat sink pad connects to the ground plane layer on the PCB and helps cool the module.

This adapter uses two sets of 10 pin, 2mm SMD connection headers. These <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=SAM1172-11-nd">11-pin break-away headers</a> work well, just be sure to break off the extra left-facing pin.
